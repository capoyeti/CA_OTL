# Offer and Agreement

## By signing this document, the Tenant makes an irrevocable offer that will remain valid for {{otl_valid_period_number}} ({{otl_valid_period_text}}) calendar days from the date of signature. If the Landlord has not signed by then, the offer becomes revocable.

## If the Landlord does not accept this offer within {{otl_valid_period_number}} ({{otl_valid_period_text}}) calendar days from the Tenant's signature, the offer will lapse and will no longer be valid.

## Once signed by the Tenant, this offer becomes a firm, binding, and irrevocable proposal. Upon the Landlord's signature (or that of its nominee), it will form a binding lease agreement between the Landlord and the Tenant. Any changes to this agreement must be made in writing and signed by both parties to be effective.

## Until the Landlord signs this offer to lease, the Tenant cannot claim that any lease agreement exists, whether express, implied, or oral.

## When the Landlord signs the standard lease agreement, it will be the sole agreement between the parties concerning the tenancy of the premises described herein. If the Tenant does not sign the standard lease, this offer will remain valid as the only lease document, governing the Tenant's tenancy under this document and common law. However, in this case, the Landlord may choose to withdraw from the agreement, and the Tenant will have no claims against the Landlord.

*ERF {{property_erf_number}}, of the Township {{property_township}} X Extension ), {{property_area}}, {{property_province}}.*

And any other additional erf upon which the SHOPPING CENTRE is situated;

# Premises (Shop Number and Size)

As shown on the attached letting plan **Annexure "A"**, <shop number {{premises_shop_number}}>, measuring approximately {{premises_size_sqm}}m² ("the PREMISES"), is identified. Any size variation of less than {{premises_size_variation_percent}}% from the recorded area, as certified by the Landlord's Architect using the SAPOA method of measurement, will not affect the rental or other costs outlined in this agreement. The plan is solely for the purpose of identifying the premises, and no guarantees are made regarding its details.

# Trading Date and Commencement Date

## The Tenant shall commence trading on {{trading_commencement_date}} 20{{trading_commencement_year}}

## The lease commencement date shall begin on the first day of the month {{lease_commencement_month}} 20{{lease_commencement_year}} following the month in which trading commenced.

## If trading started on any day other than the 1st. Rent for the period prior to lease commencement will be calculated on a pro-rata basis of the first month's rent.

## The Tenant is required to begin trading on the premises and pay rent starting on the day immediately following the end of the beneficial occupation period.

# Lease Period (No. of years)

The lease term shall be a fixed period of {{lease_period_years}} years, beginning on the commencement date ("the commencement date"), subject to the provisions of clause 4 below.

# Beneficial Occupation Date

## The Tenant will be given a {{beneficial_occupation_period}} day period of beneficial occupation before the lease begins. This period is intended to allow the Tenant to prepare the premises for the start of trading on the lease commencement date.

## No rent will be charged during the beneficial occupation period; however, the Tenant will be responsible for rates and taxes, water, electricity, air-conditioning maintenance, and refuse removal charges for the period before the trading date. The Landlord will make every effort to provide the Tenant with timely access to the premises. If access is delayed past the scheduled or revised beneficial occupation date mentioned in **clauses 6.1 and this clause 6.2,** the Tenant will have no claim against the Landlord or its agents.

## The lease start date will be extended to the earlier of either the date the Tenant begins trading or the end of the beneficial occupation period. The lease end date will also be adjusted to ensure that the full lease period, as stated in **clause 5**, is provided. Regardless of the actual start date, the rent and other amounts will escalate annually, based on the commencement date, as outlined in **clauses 4.2 and this clause 7.3.**

## The Tenant agrees to start the physical fit-out of the premises within {{fitout_start_hours}} ({{fitout_start_hours_text}}) hours of access. The Tenant acknowledges the timeline prepared by the Landlord's Architect and commits to collaborating with the Architect to adhere to the schedule during the fit-out period.

## The Tenant must comply with all applicable statutory requirements, including the Occupational Health and Safety Act, during the scheduled and/or revised beneficial occupation and while occupying the premises. At the Tenant's expense, a Certificate of Electrical Compliance and an Occupation Certificate must be obtained within {{compliance_cert_days}} ({{compliance_cert_days_text}}) days after completing the beneficial occupation and annually on the lease commencement anniversary.

## Tenant will not have access to the premises until the lease is signed and the cheque mentioned in **clause 17** has cleared.

## If the Tenant fails to begin trading on the trading date as specified in **clause 4.1,** including for the duration of the lease term despite being granted beneficial occupation as described above, the Landlord will have the right to charge {{penalty_multiplier}} ({{penalty_multiplier_text}}) times the daily rental for each day the Tenant does not trade from the premises. The daily rental will be calculated by taking the monthly gross rental, multiplying it by twelve, and dividing by {{days_in_year}}.

# Installation And Fit Out

## The Tenant shall be responsible for installing fixtures and fittings and fitting out the premises according to the approved concept design and the Landlord's Tenant Criteria Document, a copy of which is attached as **Annexure "B."** If the Tenant requests any variations to the standard specifications, these will be priced and may be carried out by the Landlord on a prepaid basis.

## Tenant must hire a qualified architect and/or interior designer to create the shop layout and prepare drawings for the Landlord's approval before proceeding with the fit-out. Any delays in obtaining this approval will be considered a material breach of the agreement.

## The Landlord's contribution to the Tenant will only be provided after one of the following conditions is met:

### The Tenant accepts the premises as complete;

### The Standard Agreement of Lease has been signed and stamped.

## The gross rental consists of the base rent plus operating costs.

## The gross rental will escalate each year on the anniversary of the lease commencement date by {{annual_escalation_rate}}% compounded annually.

## The rental and any other charges outlined in this offer are to be paid monthly in advance or upon receipt of an invoice, due on the first day of each month starting from the lease commencement date, either by Debit Order **(Annexure "H")** or EFT.

# Marketing

From the trading date, the Tenant will be responsible for marketing cost contributions of {{marketing_contribution_percent}}% (excluding VAT), which will increase at the same rate as the rental, compounded throughout the lease term. The Tenant acknowledges that these contributions are intended for the marketing of the entire centre, not just the premises.

# Parking

Tenant parking is provided at a rate of R{{parking_rate_per_bay}} per bay per month for covered parking. The Tenant agrees to lease {{parking_bays_number}} ({{parking_bays_text}}) parking bay for the duration of the lease. The parking rental will escalate annually on the anniversary of the lease commencement date at a compounded rate of {{parking_escalation_rate}}%.

# Turnover Rental Percentage

## The turnover rental payable by the Tenant for the leased premises shall be the higher of the rental specified in **Clause 7.1** or {{turnover_percentage}}% of the Tenant's net annual audited turnover.

## Turnover rental will be due annually within {{turnover_payment_days}} ({{turnover_payment_days_text}}) days following the Tenant's financial year-end. It is specifically noted that any rental fees for Tenant parking will not be included in the turnover calculation.

## "Turnover" for any period refers to the net cash selling price of all goods and services sold from the premises by the Tenant and any sub-tenant, excluding interest, finance charges, credit card fees, and any other costs, taxes, or charges related to the sale. This includes sales made for cash, credit, hire purchase, online, or otherwise. The calculation will deduct all reasonable discounts, credits for traded-in, returned, or repossessed goods, and any amounts written off as bad debts. Should any previously written-off amounts be recovered, they will be included in the net turnover for the lease year in which they are recovered.

## The Tenant must provide the Landlord with a {{turnover_forecast_period}} ({{turnover_forecast_period_text}}) -month forecast of projected turnover for the premises each year. For the first year of the lease, this forecast should be submitted upon signing the lease. Forecasts for the subsequent years must be provided annually on the Tenant's financial year-end.

## Regardless of other provisions in this offer, the Tenant must send the Landlord an unaudited statement of turnover for the previous month within {{monthly_turnover_days}} ({{monthly_turnover_days_text}}) days after the end of each calendar month. The Landlord will treat this information as confidential and will use it solely to assess trading trends, not for calculating turnover rentals.

# Penalty for Not Trading

If the Tenant fails to open for trading for the duration of the lease term the Landlord will have the right to charge {{non_trading_penalty_multiplier}} ({{non_trading_penalty_multiplier_text}}) times the daily rental for each day the Tenant does not trade from the premises. The daily rental will be calculated by taking the monthly gross rental, multiplying it by twelve, and dividing by {{annual_days}}.

# Premises Usage and Trading Name

## The Tenant is permitted to use the premises solely for the retail sale of {{permitted_usage}} and for no other purpose.

## The Tenant will operate under the trading name {{trading_name}}.

If the premises are not individually metered, the consumption will be calculated based on the area of the premises compared to the total gross lettable area (GLA) of the property (pro rata). Additionally, the Tenant will be responsible for its pro rata share of electricity costs for common areas of the property, which includes electricity used for signage and the air conditioning system servicing those areas.

## **Water**: The Tenant will be charged for the metered cost of all water used, plus a fee for reading the meter, starting from the date of beneficial occupation. If the premises are not individually metered, consumption will be calculated based on the area of the premises relative to the gross lettable area (GLA) of the property (pro rata).

# Other Costs (Monthly Charges)

## **Air-conditioning:** The Tenant is responsible for the costs of repairs, maintenance, and water and electricity consumption for the air-conditioning unit serving the premises from the date of beneficial occupation. If the air-conditioning unit is shared among multiple tenants rather than dedicated to specific premises, the pro rata costs will be calculated based on the area of the premises in relation to the gross lettable area (GLA) served by the unit.

## **Tenant Insurance:** The Tenant is responsible for the cost of insuring the premises, its contents, the plate glass shopfronts, stock, fittings, and fixtures, as well as any malicious damage resulting from burglaries, all starting from the date of beneficial occupation.
